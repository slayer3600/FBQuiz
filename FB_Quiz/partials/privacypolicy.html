    <ul>
        <li>We regularly receive non-personally-identifying information about you or about the device you use to enhance our services, such as your browser type, language preference referring site and any other information automatically sent to us by the user's browser.</li>
        <li>We receive data about you whenever you use or interact with us, such as how and when you view, use or otherwise interact with content and materials in our WebSite. For example, we may infer data from your replies and answers to the quizzes in this WebSite or the results thereof, as further delineated below.</li>
        <li>When you post or create content on our site, such as feedbacks, quizzes or other games, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you posted or created such content.</li>
        <li>Sometimes we get data from our partners, publishers, commercial customers and other third parties that helps us (or them) deliver ads, understand our users' online activities, provide with insight into what our users are interested in, maximize the effectiveness of ads, and generally make our services better.</li>
        <li>We receive data whenever you visit another website that uses our platform or which has embedded our content into its own website, blog or application. Such data includes the other websites you have visited and the type of data we receive about you while you use this Website as delineated hereunder</li>
    </ul>

    We store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others (including those described hereunder), but some information may remain in backup copies and logs for longer periods. However, you acknowledge and agree that We may continue to use any non-personally-identifying information in accordance with this Privacy Policy (e.g., for the purpose of analysis, statistics and the like) also after the termination of your membership to this WebSite and\or use of our services, for any reason whatsoever.

<h4>How we use your information</h4>
<p>
    We use the information and data we collect in connection with operation, maintenance and enhancement of our services and features, and for other administrative purposes or internal operations, such as communicating with our users, data analysis, testing and research.

    In addition, We may use the information and data we collect about you in order to measure and understand the effectiveness of our ads and other content and offer you tailored content, like giving you more relevant ads. For example, your birthday, gender and other demographic characteristics allow us to show you age-appropriate and gender-related content and advertisements. We may also examine and analyze your feedback and answers to the quizzes in our WebSite to serve ads that you may enjoy or find interesting. For example, if a user participates in content around new model cars, We may infer that this user is planning to purchase a new vehicle or that he/she recently purchased a new vehicle. Alternatively, if a user indicates in a quiz that he/she enjoys baseball, We may infer this user is a sport fan. Advertisers of either automotive or sports products may ask us to display advertisements to individuals that have an affinity towards their products.

    We processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. Such information may be stored on any of our servers, at any location.
